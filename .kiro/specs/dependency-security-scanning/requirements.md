# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for implementing comprehensive dependency security scanning as part of the security audit remediation (Task 10). The feature will provide automated vulnerability detection, dependency risk assessment, and integration with the existing security monitoring system to ensure all third-party dependencies are secure and up-to-date.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a security administrator, I want automated dependency vulnerability scanning, so that I can identify and address security risks in third-party packages before they impact the application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs a dependency scan THEN it SHALL detect all known vulnerabilities using npm audit
2. WHEN vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL classify them by severity (critical, high, moderate, low)
3. WHEN critical vulnerabilities are detected THEN the system SHALL create immediate security alerts
4. IF npm audit fails THEN the system SHALL use fallback vulnerability detection methods
5. WHEN a scan completes THEN the system SHALL provide detailed vulnerability reports with remediation recommendations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to identify outdated dependencies, so that I can keep the application secure and benefit from the latest security patches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system scans dependencies THEN it SHALL identify packages with available updates
2. WHEN outdated packages are found THEN the system SHALL categorize updates by type (major, minor, patch)
3. WHEN security-related updates are available THEN the system SHALL prioritize them in recommendations
4. WHEN many packages are outdated THEN the system SHALL provide bulk update recommendations
5. IF package information is unavailable THEN the system SHALL log warnings without failing the scan

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want CI/CD integration for dependency scanning, so that security vulnerabilities are caught before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the CI/CD pipeline runs THEN it SHALL execute dependency security scans automatically
2. WHEN critical vulnerabilities are found THEN the build SHALL fail with clear error messages
3. WHEN the scan completes THEN it SHALL generate machine-readable reports for further processing
4. IF the scan takes too long THEN it SHALL timeout gracefully without blocking deployment
5. WHEN scan results are available THEN they SHALL be stored for historical tracking

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a security team member, I want real-time dependency risk monitoring, so that I can respond quickly to newly discovered vulnerabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new vulnerabilities are discovered THEN the system SHALL send immediate notifications
2. WHEN dependency risk levels change THEN the security dashboard SHALL update in real-time
3. WHEN critical alerts are triggered THEN they SHALL include specific remediation steps
4. IF alert thresholds are exceeded THEN the system SHALL escalate notifications appropriately
5. WHEN vulnerabilities are resolved THEN the system SHALL automatically update risk assessments

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive dependency security reporting, so that I can track security posture over time and demonstrate compliance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating security reports THEN the system SHALL include dependency vulnerability summaries
2. WHEN calculating security scores THEN dependency risks SHALL be factored into the overall score
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL provide historical trend analysis
4. IF compliance reporting is needed THEN the system SHALL export data in standard formats
5. WHEN audit trails are required THEN all dependency security events SHALL be logged with timestamps

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want programmatic access to dependency security data, so that I can integrate vulnerability information with external security tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requesting dependency data via API THEN the system SHALL return current vulnerability status
2. WHEN querying specific packages THEN the system SHALL provide detailed security information
3. WHEN accessing scan results THEN the API SHALL support filtering by severity and package type
4. IF rate limiting is applied THEN API responses SHALL include appropriate headers
5. WHEN authentication is required THEN the API SHALL validate access tokens securely

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a development team lead, I want dependency security integration with the security dashboard, so that I can monitor all security aspects from a single interface.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the security dashboard THEN dependency vulnerabilities SHALL be prominently displayed
2. WHEN dependency risks change THEN dashboard metrics SHALL update automatically
3. WHEN critical issues exist THEN the dashboard SHALL highlight them with appropriate urgency indicators
4. IF scan data is unavailable THEN the dashboard SHALL show graceful fallback messages
5. WHEN drill-down details are needed THEN the dashboard SHALL provide links to detailed vulnerability reports
