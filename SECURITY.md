# Security Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Glada Fönster website.

## Security Measures Implemented

### 1. Input Validation & Sanitization
- All form inputs are validated and sanitized
- Length limits enforced on all fields
- XSS prevention through input sanitization
- Email and phone format validation
- Name field validation (letters only)

### 2. Rate Limiting
- Contact form submissions limited to 3 per 15 minutes per email
- In-memory rate limiting with automatic cleanup

### 3. Security Headers
- X-Frame-Options: DENY (prevents clickjacking)
- X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff (prevents MIME sniffing)
- X-XSS-Protection: enabled
- Content Security Policy configured
- Referrer Policy set to strict-origin-when-cross-origin

### 4. Environment Security
- Sensitive credentials removed from version control
- Minimal logging in production
- API key validation without exposure

### 5. reCAPTCHA Protection
- Google reCAPTCHA v3 integration
- Server-side token verification
- Protection against automated submissions

### 6. Secure Error Handling (NEW - Phase 1)
- Generic error messages prevent information disclosure
- Detailed errors logged server-side only
- Error codes for internal tracking
- No sensitive information exposed to users
- Structured security event logging

### 7. Health Endpoint Security (NEW - Phase 1)
- Minimal response data (no sensitive configuration details)
- Server-side logging for monitoring
- No API key information exposed
- Simple status reporting only

### 8. Enhanced Rate Limiting (NEW - Phase 2)
- Multi-layer rate limiting (email + IP address)
- Progressive delay system with exponential backoff
- Different limits for different endpoints
- Rate limiting for health endpoint
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging

### 9. Production Logging System (NEW - Phase 2)
- Environment-based log levels (dev vs production)
- Structured JSON logging for production
- Security-specific logging with error codes
- No sensitive information in logs
- Proper log formatting and context

### 10. Strengthened Content Security Policy (NEW - Phase 2)
- Removed unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval directives
- Specific domain allowlists for external resources
- Added object-src 'none' and base-uri 'self'
- Form-action restrictions
- Additional security headers (Permissions-Policy, HSTS)

### 11. Dependency Security (NEW - Phase 2)
- All dependencies locked to specific versions
- Removed "latest" version specifiers
- Predictable security posture
- Easier vulnerability tracking

### 12. Environment Variable Management (NEW - Phase 3)
- Automated validation of all environment variables
- Production vs development key validation
- Secure configuration checking
- Environment-specific security warnings

### 13. Security Monitoring Dashboard (NEW - Phase 3)
- Real-time security metrics and monitoring
- Security event tracking and analysis
- Automated threat detection
- Comprehensive security scoring system

### 14. Automated Security Scanning (NEW - Phase 3)
- Comprehensive security vulnerability scanning
- Runtime security checks
- Dependency security validation
- Automated security recommendations

## Security Best Practices

### Environment Variables
Never commit sensitive data to version control:
```bash
# ❌ NEVER do this
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=actual_secret_key

# ✅ Use placeholder values
RECAPTCHA_SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key_here
```

### API Keys
- Always use environment variables for API keys
- Validate API key format before use
- Never log API keys or sensitive data

### Input Handling
- Always validate and sanitize user inputs
- Use strict validation patterns
- Implement length limits
- Escape HTML characters

### Error Handling (Phase 1 Implementation)
- Use generic error messages for users
- Log detailed errors server-side only
- Implement error codes for tracking
- Never expose internal system information
- Structure security events for monitoring

### Rate Limiting (Phase 2 Implementation)
- Implement multi-layer protection (email + IP)
- Use progressive delays with exponential backoff
- Configure different limits per endpoint type
- Monitor and log rate limit violations
- Automatic cleanup of expired entries

### Logging (Phase 2 Implementation)
- Use structured logging with proper levels
- Environment-based configuration (dev vs prod)
- Security-specific logging functions
- No sensitive data in log outputs
- Proper context and metadata inclusion

### Content Security Policy (Phase 2 Implementation)
- Remove unsafe directives where possible
- Use specific domain allowlists
- Implement additional security headers
- Regular CSP violation monitoring
- Balance security with functionality

### Environment Management (Phase 3 Implementation)
- Validate all environment variables on startup
- Check for production vs development key usage
- Monitor configuration security
- Automated environment validation
- Secure configuration recommendations

### Security Monitoring (Phase 3 Implementation)
- Real-time security event tracking
- Automated threat detection and response
- Security metrics collection and analysis
- Dashboard for security status monitoring
- Comprehensive security scoring

### Automated Security Scanning (Phase 3 Implementation)
- Regular vulnerability scans
- Runtime security checks
- Dependency security validation
- Configuration security analysis
- Automated security recommendations
